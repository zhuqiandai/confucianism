> keep the sentence structure and consistent 保持句子紧凑平滑，句子主语、语气等一致

1. Place the participial phrase directly next to the noun it modifies.

e.g. Frightened by the thunder, the dog hid behind the couch. (_Frightened modifies the dog_)

- misplaced modifier
- dangling modifier

2. If a nonrestrictive participial phrase modifies a subject, separate it with a comma.

e.g. Pedor, waiting for his friend to arrive, answerd emails on his phone.

To be safe, it’s best to use a nonrestrictive participial phrase before the subject at the beginning of the sentence.

3. Place restrictive participial phrases after the nouns they modify and do not use a comma.

e.g. The woman wearing the big red clown nose is my girlfriend.

Restrictive participial phrases always come after the noun they modify.

4. If the participial phrase modifies a noun that’s not the subject, place it directly after the noun without a comma.

e.g. Dressed in the outfit chosen by her parents, Alice covered her face so people wouldn’t see her.
