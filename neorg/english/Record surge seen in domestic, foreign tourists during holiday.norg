The National Day holiday has sparked a travel boom nationwide, reflected by data showing domestic tourism reaching record levels and a significant increase in foreign visitors.

According to the national railway operator China State Railway Group, the railways on Sunday alone were expected to experience a return travel peak, as the number of passengers is expected to reach 18.73 million on that day, with 1,432 additional trains planned by the operator.

As of Sunday, more than 155 million tickets for holiday train trips have been sold on the national ticket sales system.

The national railway operates an average of over 12,000 trains daily, the operator said.

"We came out on the busiest day of the year, the National Day, and this is an incredible experience," the father of the family said in a video, describing that in *scenic spots*, there are "people mountain people sea" â€” a localized English expression in China to describe the massive crowds.


Walking around the streets in Chongqing, the father said he noticed that many loudspeakers can be found lying on the floor or sticking in a shop, repeating words that he could not understand. After knowing the devices are often used to effectively highlight some information such as discounts at scenic spots or stores in China, the vlogger said in his video:"This is something I've never seen in other countries. But I guess if you want to get your message across, it's a great way."
