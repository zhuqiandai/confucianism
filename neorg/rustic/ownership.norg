> full ownership semanticsï¼Œon the stack, when the function call ends, Rust deallocates the stack frame.

** Copy

   - primitive types
   - tuple of primitive types
   - struct impl `Copy trait` (every fields)

*** Copy trait

** Clone

   > The idea of `Clone` is to make it easy to spot *where heap allocation are occurring*.

*** Clone trait

** Move semantics

   > transfer ownership by assignment

@code rust 
fn main () {
  println!("hello")
}
@end

** Borrow semantics

   > not transfer ownership, borrow access to read, use `&` or `mut &`

** Drop semantics

*** Drop trait


** Slice Type
